# Noxious-Gas-Detection-System-for-Coal-Mines
This project showcases the development of a sensor integration system using ESP32, to transmit eight key parameters to InfluxDB over Wi-Fi. The data is then visualized in real-time on a Grafana and a  significant enhancement in detection accuracy, was achieved through the implementation of a Bayesian sensor fusion algorithm on a Raspberry Pi 4
